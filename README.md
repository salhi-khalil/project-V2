this is about doctors and Patients ...

The idea is that the visitor before being a Patient can see the doctors list..

if he want to take and  get an appointment he have to sign in.

the doctor in the other side must fill an other type of sign in to get well known...

the subscribe is easy and all content will be accessible..

we used here the MERN stack... :  MongoDB Express React and NodeJs...

the models are taken easy...

the use of some middlewares ...

we hashed password using bcrypt ...
